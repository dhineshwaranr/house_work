							<p>The Spring Framework is an application framework and 
							inversion of control container for the Java platform. The 
							framework's core features can be used by any Java application, 
							but there are extensions for building web applications on top of 
							the Java EE platform. Although the framework does not impose any 
							specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community 
							as an alternative to, replacement for, or even addition to the Enterprise 
							JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.</p>
							<p>
							The first version was written by Rod Johnson, who released the framework 
							with the publication of his book Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development 
							in October 2002. The framework was first released under the Apache 2.0 license 
							in June 2003. The first milestone release, 1.0, was released in March 2004, 
							with further milestone releases in September 2004 and March 2005. The Spring 1.2.6 
							framework won a Jolt productivity award and a JAX Innovation Award in 2006.[3][4] 
							Spring 2.0 was released in October 2006, Spring 2.5 in November 2007, Spring 3.0 in 
							December 2009, Spring 3.1 in December 2011, and Spring 3.2.5 in November 2013.[5] 
							Spring Framework 4.0 was released in December 2013.[6] Notable improvements in Spring 
							4.0 included support for Java SE 8, Groovy 2, some aspects of Java EE7, and WebSocket.</p>
							<p>Spring Framework 4.2.0 was released on 31 July 2015 and was immediately upgraded to 
							version 4.2.1, which was released on 01 Sept 2015.[7] It is "compatible with Java 6, 7 
							and 8, with a focus on core refinements and modern web capabilities".[8]</p>
							<p>Spring Framework 4.3 has been released on 10 June 2016. The 4.3.0.RC1 [9] 
							version is available. It "will be the final generation within the general Spring 
							4 system requirements (Java 6+, Servlet 2.5+), getting prepared for an extended 
							4.3.x support life until 2019".</p>
